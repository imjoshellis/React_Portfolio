              <p> Software Engineer with a passion for enhancing my IT knowledge,
                 expressing my creativity & pushing myself passed my comfort zone.
                  Diligent & capable of adapting to various situations, I have been 
                  programming for over a year building projects. Through my time at 
                  Flatiron, I’ve learned the necessary material on my own & work well 
                  in a team environment. I’m most proud of my Movie Review app that
                   allows a user to sign up using a form I created or sign in using a 
                   third-party site using OmniAuth. They’re able to create movies that they
                    & others can comment on & rate on. There’s a lot of interesting user-friendly
                     functionalities & validations to help guide users across the site. I would be 
                     an asset to your team not strictly because of my skill set but because I am fully
                      willing & able to learn more & advise where needed. My positive outlook on problem-solving
                       is key to a healthy work environment.

                              I learned several technologies including
                              Bcrypt, CSS/HTML, Devise, Javascript, OmniAuth, React, Redux, Ruby on Rails and Sinatra. I've been able to use this new found knowledge to build many projects from the client-side to the server-side.  I passed all of my assesments on the first attempts. 
                              Going through this course has enhanced my time management skills and showcased my capabilty of learning new material fairly quickly.  </h4>

                            In Highschool, I spent a lot of time in 
                            creative arts and tinkering the HTML on my Myspace
                             page. I was a part of my high school yearbook 
                             committee, where I was in charge of several sections. 
                             I conducted interviews and structured the layout of 
                             the column. Through this, I found my love for photography 
                             and took several classes.  After high school, I enrolled 
                             a semester earlier than my peers to the University of Central Florida to pursue film.
